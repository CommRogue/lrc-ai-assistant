# LRC-Gemini

A Lightroom Classic to fill keywords, image title and caption by using Google AI Gemini. (gemini-flash-1.5)

# Your photos will be sent to Google for this! Do not use the plugin, if you don't agree with this!

## Usage
* Install plugin using Lightroom addon module manager
* [Obtain Google Gemini API key from Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
* Configure language, phrases and API key in Lightroom module manager
* Additionally you can choose which fields are to be filled, by the enable checkbox.
  Keep in mind that every field requires one Gemini prompt, and you are limited to 1500 per day in the free version.
* Go to Library in Lightroom
* Select some photos
* Go to menu -> Library -> Addon Modules -> Run Google AI Gemini plugin
* Wait it to fill your keywords, caption or title as selected.

## Google rate limits
The free version of gemini-flash-1.5 is limited to 1500 prompts per day. 
There's also a soft limit on how many requests per minute are allowed, which can of course be circumvented by waiting for a few seconds, when a request is denied.
The plugin waits for 5 seconds after each denied prompt, if the error 'RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED' persists for 10 of these wait loops, it assumes that the daily limit has been hit, and stops the process with an error message.

## Notes
* Google AI has safety features, so some content is blocked. Especially:
  * Nudity
  * Dangerous scenes
  * Hatecrime
  * ...
 If a photo gets denied by a safety blocked, it will be skipped without further notice (for now).
* All generated keywords are hierarchically beneath the top keyword "Google AI". Beneath that, there is no more hierarchy.
  But you can easily remove all keywords generated by the plugin, by deleting the top Google AI keyword.
  Additionally you can create smart collections with filters for Google AI to keep track of photos that have or haven't been analyzed yet.
* Feel free to open issues or discussions. Any feedback is welcome.
